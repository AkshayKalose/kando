# Using Kando

Kando comes with a small example menu which you can use to get started.
However, you should soon [configure your own menu](configuring.md) to make the most out of Kando.


## ðŸš€ Starting Kando for the First Time

When you launch Kando, nothing will happen at first.
You will only see a small icon in the system tray.
However, on most platforms, you can open an example menu by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>.

There are some exceptions where this will not work.
See the [platform-specific installation notes](installing.md#platform-specific-notes) for details.
It can also happen that the shortcut is already used by another application.
In this case, you can use the tray icon to open the settings and change the shortcut of the example menu.

## ðŸ”„ Navigating in Menus

Kando features several navigation methods, and you can seemlessly switch between them.
At first, you will probably use the point-and-click method.
Once you get more comfortable with Kando, you can try the marking mode, and even the turbo mode.

| Navigation Method | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Point and Click:** The most basic approach for selecting items is by clicking at them. Although you do not have to click directly at the item, anywhere in the item's wedge will do! <br><br> This can make selections very fast as you **do not have to aim carefully**. | <video width="100%" controls align="right"><source src="../assets/videos/introduction-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> |
| **Navigating Back:** If you entered a submenu by accident, you can always go back by selecting the parent item. It is only possible to go back one level at a time! <br><br> Alternatively, you can also **click in the center of the current submenu** to quickly go up one level. | <video width="100%" controls align="right"><source src="../assets/videos/introduction-2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> |
| **Marking Mode:** With Kando, you can select items by drawing gestures! To do so, simply press your left mouse button, and drag over an item. You will move the item around, until you stop the movement or make a sharp turn. Try to remember the path to an item and draw it without looking much at the menu! You will be surprised how quickly you can select items which are deeply nested in the menu. <br><br> **For successful selections, it is better to draw expressive zig-zag lines instead of shy and curvy lines :smiley:** | <video width="100%" controls align="right"><source src="../assets/videos/introduction-3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> |
| **Turbo Mode:** If you opened the menu using a key combination involving a modifier key such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, or <kbd>Meta</kbd>, you can keep it pressed. If you do so, the menu will behave as if the left mouse button is pressed until you release the key. <br><br> **This allows you to make even faster selections!** | <video width="100%" controls align="right"><source src="../assets/videos/introduction-4.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> |
| **Exploring Items:** Kando will never select a menu item as long as the left mouse button (or a modifier key in _Turbo Mode_) is pressed. This means, as long as you keep the button or the key pressed, you can explore the menu! | <video width="100%" controls align="right"><source src="../assets/videos/introduction-5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> |
